# School_District_Analysis

## Purpose of the analysis

This analysis was conducted to see which test score metrics were present in what schools in some sample student
and school data. In addition, I conducted a further repurposing of the analysis because academic dishonesty was discovered
concerning 9th graders at Thomas High School.
