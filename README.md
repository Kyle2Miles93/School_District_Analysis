# School_District_Analysis

## Purpose of the analysis

This analysis was conducted to see which test score metrics were present in what schools in some sample student
and school data. In addition, I conducted a further repurposing of the analysis because academic dishonesty was discovered
concerning 9th graders at Thomas High School. 

## Results

Here is an image of the District Summary dataframe before the data was repurposed because of academic dishonesty:

The average math scores, reading scores, as well as the overall passing rates changed, here is Thomas High School afterward:

## Summary

The math scores, reading scores, and overall passing rates for both **Math** and **Reading**  for Thomas High School increased significantly when the 9th graders were excluded from the data.
Relative to other schools, they excel in both categories, in the 90s for each subject. 
Both their scores and their percentages compared to others are in the top five highest when the data was excluded.
